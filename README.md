**Advent of Code** is an annual advent calendar of small programming puzzles, made by Eric Wastl.

From the 1st to the 25th of December a new puzzle is released, each providing an input file. Each puzzle will have a description and require you to solve the puzzle and enter the answer to retrieve stars, with 2 parts to the puzzle per day.

I have chosen to complete these puzzles using Python.
